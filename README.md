### Smart Home and Raspberry Pi Setup

#### Raspberry Pi:
- Acts as the central hub for the smart home system.
- Runs Raspberry Pi OS (previously Raspbian) as the operating system.
- Interfaces with various hardware components such as sensors and Zigbee coordinator.

#### Sensors (Temperature and Humidity):
- Connected to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins or via USB.
- Responsible for monitoring environmental conditions within the home.
- Examples include DHT11, DHT22, DS18B20 sensors.

#### Zigbee Coordinator:
- Connected to the Raspberry Pi via USB.
- Utilizes Zigbee software stack (e.g., Zigbee2MQTT) for communication with Zigbee devices.
- Facilitates interaction with Zigbee-enabled devices such as lights, switches, and sensors.

### Web Application for Reading and Controlling Devices

#### Backend Architecture:

1. **Node.js Backend with Express.js**:
   - Node.js serves as the runtime environment for the backend.
   - Express.js is used as the web framework to handle HTTP requests and responses.

2. **Middleware**:
   - **body-parser**: Parses incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the `req.body` property.
   - **cors**: Provides Cross-Origin Resource Sharing support for allowing the frontend to communicate with the backend from a different origin.

3. **Data Storage**:
   - **MongoDB or SQLite**: Choice of database for storing sensor data, device configurations, and user information.
   - MongoDB provides flexibility and scalability for handling large volumes of data.
   - SQLite offers simplicity and ease of setup for smaller-scale applications.

#### Frontend Architecture:

1. **React.js Frontend**:
   - React.js powers the frontend user interface, providing a component-based architecture for building interactive web applications.
   - Manages the UI components and handles user interactions.

2. **State Management**:
   - Utilizes React's built-in state management capabilities for managing application state locally within components.
   - May consider using additional libraries like Redux for managing more complex state across multiple components.

3. **HTTP Requests**:
   - Axios or Fetch API used for making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend API.
   - Handles retrieval of sensor data and sending control commands to smart home devices.

### Deployment Architecture:

1. **Raspberry Pi Deployment**:
   - Deploy the web application on the Raspberry Pi, ensuring it is accessible within the local network.
   - Configure port forwarding on the router to allow external access to the Raspberry Pi from the internet.

2. **Domain Name and DNS Configuration**:
   - Obtain a domain name for the web application.
   - Configure DNS settings to point the domain to the public IP address of the Raspberry Pi.

3. **Secure Communication** (Optional):
   - Use SSL/TLS certificates to encrypt communication between clients and the web server, ensuring data privacy and security.
   - HTTPS protocol for secure transmission of data over the internet.
